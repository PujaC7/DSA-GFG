Given a list of names, display the longest name. If there are multiple names of the longest size then return the first occurring name .

Example1 :

Input:
n = 5
names[] = { "Geek", "Geeks", "Geeksfor", "GeeksforGeek", "GeeksforGeeks" }
Output: GeeksforGeeks
Explanation: name "GeeksforGeeks" has maximum length among all names. 

Example2 :

Input:
n = 4
names[] = { "Apple", "Mango", "Orange", "Banana" }
Output: Orange
Explanation: names "Orange" and "Banana" both have maximum length among all names but Orange comes first so answer will be "Orange". 
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function longest() which takes the array names[] and its size n as inputs and returns the Longest name in the list of names that occurs first.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
