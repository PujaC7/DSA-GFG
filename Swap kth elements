Given an array arr of size n, swap the kth element from the beginning with kth element from the end.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 8
k = 3
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Output: {1, 2, 6, 4, 5, 3, 7, 8}
Explanation:
3rd element from beginning is 3 and from end is 6.







from typing import List


class Solution:
    def swapKth(self, n : int, k : int, arr : List[int]) -> None:
        # code here
        firstSwapIndex = k
        lastSwapIndex = n-k
        
        firstSwapValue = arr[firstSwapIndex - 1]
        lastSwapValue = arr[lastSwapIndex]
        
        for i in range (n):
            if (i+1) == firstSwapIndex:
                arr[i] = lastSwapValue
            if (i) == lastSwapIndex:
                arr[i] = firstSwapValue
